This project is a semantic search and RAG-based chatbot built using Endee as a vector database.

The main purpose of this project is to demonstrate how vector databases can be used in real-world AI applications.

Endee is used in this project because it provides efficient vector similarity search, which is essential for semantic search.

Semantic search retrieves information based on the meaning of the query rather than exact keyword matching.

RAG stands for Retrieval Augmented Generation and improves answer accuracy by using retrieved documents.

In this project, documents are converted into numerical embeddings using a sentence transformer model.

The embeddings are stored in Endee, which acts as the core vector database.

When a user asks a question, the question is also converted into an embedding.

Endee compares the question embedding with stored document embeddings to find the most relevant answer.

This chatbot answers only document-based questions and avoids hallucinated responses.

If an answer is not found in the documents, the chatbot responds with an appropriate fallback message.

This project does not require an API key because it runs locally using open-source models.

The chatbot interface is designed similar to ChatGPT for better user interaction.

This project demonstrates a practical use case of semantic search using vector databases.

Such chatbots can be used in knowledge base systems, document search tools, and AI assistants.

The project is hosted on GitHub with a clean and well-documented README file.

Forking the Endee repository allows independent development without affecting the original code.

This project follows the evaluation guidelines provided by Endee Labs.

The chatbot architecture includes document ingestion, embedding generation, vector storage, retrieval, and response generation.

Endee acts as the backbone of this project by enabling fast and accurate semantic retrieval.
